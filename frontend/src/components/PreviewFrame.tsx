//The PreviewFrame component sets up a web container environment, installs the necessary dependencies, starts a development server, and displays a preview of the project in an iframe.
//Steps:
//It installs dependencies using npm install.
//It starts the development server with npm run dev.
//It listens for the server-ready event, and once the server is up, it updates the URL.
//It renders a loading state until the URL is set, after which it shows the preview using an iframe.
